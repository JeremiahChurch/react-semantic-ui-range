# react-semantic-ui-range
This is a React Component range slider for Semantic UI

It is developed based on https://github.com/tyleryasaka/semantic-ui-range

This is the original version's 
[demo](http://codepen.io/tyleryasaka/pen/KVqPbo)

The original library was using jQuery so I changed the parts that use jQuery to make it more compatible with React.

It is not fully developed yet and does not support all the functionalities that the original library provides.
